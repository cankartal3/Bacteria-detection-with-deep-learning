# Bacteria detection with deep learning
 These files contain the model and detection codes of the senior project related to deep learning.


In this project, it was aimed to detect dangerous bacteria. Three different parasites were trained in this neural network. These; babesia, plasmodium, toxoplasma.
I hope that with such projects, dangerous bacteria will be detected more than.
